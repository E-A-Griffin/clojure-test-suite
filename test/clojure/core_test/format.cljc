;;; Note that `format` presents a bit of a conundrum for
;;; testing. Clojure JVM delegates the formatting task to
;;; Java. ClojureScript doesn't implement `format`. Other Clojure
;;; implementations may take different paths. Even when `format` is
;;; implemented, the full scope of Java's `java.util.Formatter`
;;; functionality may not be there. Thus, we take a very conservative
;;; approach here for the default case of just testing to verify that
;;; the function exists and that a simple format string with no escape
;;; characters passes through `format` unharmed.
